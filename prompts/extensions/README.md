# IDE Extensions for AI Prompts

## VS Code Extension Snippet to Load Primer at AI Chat Start

This is a basic VS Code extension snippet that injects your project primer text into an AI chat session automatically when you open it. It assumes you have an AI chat panel and you can programmatically send messages (e.g., with Continue.dev or a custom AI integration).

You would install this extension or add the command to your current AI plugin.

When triggered, it sends your primer to the chat automatically.

Youâ€™d replace sendMessageToAIChat with actual API calls or VS Code AI integration commands.
