How to get the most value out of Claude Pro:
Ask multiple questions at once, especially when working with long documents. Sending multiple questions in one message is more efficient than sending them separately.

Don't re-upload files within the same conversation. Claude remembers the context from your conversation, so you don't need to upload the same file multiple times.

Use Projects when working on related tasks. Projects provide caching that saves your usage:

When you add documents to a Project, they're cached

Every time you reference that content, only uncached portions count against your limits

This means you can work with the same materials repeatedly without using up your messages as quickly
